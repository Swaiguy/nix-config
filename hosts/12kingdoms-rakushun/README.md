Storage, operation and maintenance related services are running on this host:

1. Storage such as git server, file server/browser, torrent downloader,, etc.

   - For safety, those data should be encrypted before sending to the cloud or my NAS.
1. Collect and monitor the metrics/logs of my homelab.
